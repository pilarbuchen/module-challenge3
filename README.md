# Module 3 - Third Challenge

For this challenge, I made a password generator. When clicking the button to obtain the password, the user will find that a series of different questions will prompt. Once those questions have been answered, the password will be generated. 

## Password Questions

- The questions asked to the user to generate the password are the following:
1. Obtaining confirmation to ensure the user wants to create a password.
2. Advising the user to select a range for the characters in the password; this can be anywhere from 8 to 128 characters.
3. The user will have to comply with accepting the different characters added to the password, such as uppercase letters, lower case letters, unique names, and numbers.

After, that the password will be generated with all the information mentioned above!
